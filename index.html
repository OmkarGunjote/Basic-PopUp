            <h2>Hi, I'm Omkar</h2>
            <p>I'm a 3rd-year IT student at SCOE, passionately diving into the MERN stack. Eager to transform theoretical knowledge into hands-on expertise, I'm currently immersed in creating web applications. As I explore the realms of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, I'm shaping my skills for the dynamic world of full-stack development. Building not just code but also crafting my professional persona, I embrace the journey of continuous learning and growth.</p>
